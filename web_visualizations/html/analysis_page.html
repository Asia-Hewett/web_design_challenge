        <h1><strong>Analysis</strong></h1>
        <p>Discernable observations for the scatter plots showcasing differences in weather patterns between the Northern and Southern latitudinal locations of my six-hundred plus case cities was close to what I expected.
        <br>
        Max temperature for all cities increased the closer the city was to the equator. Cities in the Northern and Southernmost latitudinal positions began to see a decrease in their max temp, which made for a lovely scatter plot curve in overall trend.
        <br>
        There did not appear to be a correlation between the cloudiness a city was experiencing and the latitudinal position of the city on the day the data was collected. Cloudiness was one of the few factors that remained static across the six-hundred, with some just not seeing much cloud coverage and others possibly experiencing storms or other weather patterns.
        <br>
        Humidity was not as I expected it would be. Due to my data being collected during the summer months I expected higher humidity in the Northern hemisphere and lower levels of humidity in the Southern hemisphere where it is currently colder, but I cannot say that using the latitudinal position to plot the data proved my hypothesis correct, as I can only see the slightest change in the Southern hemisphere but not enough so to draw a positive conclusion.
